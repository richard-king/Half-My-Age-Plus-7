## Description

"Half My Age Plus 7" is a simple app to solve relationship dilemmas of the chronological persuasion. Born out of a late night conversation with a friend about how we needed to start making apps, and what would be a good/funny/<insert-adjective-here> idea for one, it took nearly a year to come to fruition, though of that year, about 3 hours was spent developping the app, with another hour or so on design.

##Development Team
